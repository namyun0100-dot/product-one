                    <p>Welcome to 2026. As Pluto settles deeply into Aquarius, we are witnessing a massive shift in how humanity connects. It's no longer just about technology; it's about "Spiritual Technology."</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="article1-h3-1">Why 2026 is Special</h3>
                    <p>This year, the alignment of Jupiter and Neptune suggests a surge in collective empathy. You might find yourself feeling more connected to nature, the stars, and even strangers. It's not a coincidence; it's the cosmic weather.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="article1-h3-2">Key Dates to Watch</h3>
                    <p>Keep an eye on the Solar Eclipse in August. It will be a powerful time for setting intentions related to your career and public image. Don't be afraid to dream big.</p>

                <div class="article-meta" id="article2-meta">January 28, 2026 | Psychology & Stars</div>
                <div class="article-content" id="article2-content">
                    <p>We love MBTI. We love Zodiac signs. But did you know they share a common root in ancient elemental theory? Let's break down the 4 Elements (Fire, Earth, Air, Water) and how they map to modern personality types.</p>

                    <h3 id="article2-h3-1">🔥 Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) ≈ NF Types</h3>
                    <p>Fire signs are driven by intuition and feeling. They are the "Idealists" (ENFP, INFJ, INFP, ENFJ). They burn with passion and are often the ones starting new movements.</p>

                    <h3 id="article2-h3-2">🌍 Earth (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) ≈ SJ Types</h3>
                    <p>Earth signs ground us. They correspond to the "Guardians" (ISTJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ESFJ). Practical, reliable, and focused on the tangible world.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="article2-h3-3">🌬️ Air (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) ≈ NT Types</h3>
                    <p>Air represents the intellect. The "Rationals" (INTJ, INTP, ENTJ, ENTP) fit here perfectly. They analyze, communicate, and innovate.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="article2-h3-4">💧 Water (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) ≈ SP Types?</h3>
                    <p>Actually, Water is unique. While often linked to 'Feeling', its adaptability also mirrors the "Artisans" (ISFP, ESFP, ISTP, ESTP) who flow with the moment. Water signs feel deeply and react instinctively.</p>

                <div class="article-content" id="article3-content">
                    <p>Look at your dominant hand. See the top horizontal line running from under your pinky finger towards your index finger? That's your Heart Line. It reveals your emotional style, not just your romantic future.</p>

                    <h3 id="article3-h3-1">Long & Curved?</h3>
                    <p>If it curves up towards your index finger, you are a romantic at heart. You express feelings openly and love deeply.</p>

                    <h3 id="article3-h3-2">Straight & Short?</h3>
                    <p>If it ends under the middle finger, you might be more practical or even a bit selfish in love. You need your freedom.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="article3-h3-3">Broken Line?</h3>
                    <p>Don't worry, it doesn't mean a broken heart forever. It often indicates a major emotional stress or change that you have overcome.</p>

                <div class="article-content" id="article4-content">
                    <p>Located just below the Heart Line, the Head Line represents your intellect, mentality, and how you process information. It's not about how smart you are, but *how* you think.</p>

                    <h3 id="article4-h3-1">Long & Deep?</h3>
                    <p>You have a clear focus and good concentration. You tend to think things through thoroughly before acting. A true strategist.</p>

                    <h3 id="article4-h3-2">Curved Downwards?</h3>
                    <p>A curve towards the wrist indicates a creative and imaginative mind. You might be an artist, writer, or dreamer who relies on intuition.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="article4-h3-3">Straight Across?</h3>
                    <p>A straight line suggests a practical, logical, and analytical approach. You prefer facts over feelings and excel in math, science, or business.</p>
